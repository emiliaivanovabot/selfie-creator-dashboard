### 4. Design System Improvements

#### Icon Integration
- All icons now use proper Lucide React components

2. **Consistency**: Unified icon system using Lucide React
3. **Performance**: Removed Unicode emoji rendering overhead
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to customize and theme icons
5. **Professional Design**: Clean, modern aesthetic without emojis
